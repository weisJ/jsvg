Some remarks on the non-formatting related conventions for this project:
- If possible classes should expose a minimal amout of internal details. It isn't an aim of this project to provide dom introspection.
- If possible classes should be immutable.
- Where possible all fields and method parameters should be marked `@Nullable` or `@NotNull`.
- Accessor methods don't use the `getThing` beans standard but are simply called `thing`.
